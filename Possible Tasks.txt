intermitent bug where one card ends up flipped permanently. Might need to re-evaluate if the active card trigger can be bugged.
The scores list have colons for the places and for the times, this needs to change, probably ) instead.
Landscape on mobile is impossible since the cards are all offscreen. We need to change how the cards are displayed.
Tablet size the cards fall off the screen partially on landscape.
The symbols show up differently on different devices. On another note, the colorful symbols that show up were liked.
Possible improvment on the scoreboards: Keep fastest time shown, but the rest can just be most recent.
Another Scoreboard option: Have the board swap between most recent times and fastest times.
Feedback: Looks a little plain.
For those who want fast times: Make the time taken to flip to be adjustable.
Sounds: flip card sound, cheer on win, background music, stuff like that
Maybe instructions on memory games included in the menu screen.
